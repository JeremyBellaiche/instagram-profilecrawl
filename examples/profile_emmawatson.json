        "Feel free to check out the @the_press_tour if you're interested in information about sustainable fashion üíöüíöüíö Paris photocall for the @wearethecircle, which is out in France on 12th July üá´üá∑‚≠ï Dress by @louisvuitton, embroidered by hand in Atelier Vermont in Paris. The silk lace was handmade in Caudry, a small French town that specialises in lace production, in an atelier that is certified by ‚ÄòEntreprise du Patrimoine Vivant‚Äô, which is a recognition to reward French companies for the excellence of their traditional skills, and aims to preserve traditional savoir-faire that is in danger of disappearing. The lace is made from Oeko-Tex 100 certified materials, which means that they don‚Äôt contain toxic substances.\n\nShoes made in Italy by @santoniofficial, whose HQ is powered by 4,000 solar panels. Santoni also runs a school where young people can learn the craft of shoemaking.\n\n@fernandojorge uses small workshops in central S√£o Paulo to manufacture all his pieces. His motivation is to stimulate the local craftsmanship and emphasise the quality of ‚ÄúMade in Brazil‚Äù. Bag made in a family-owned factory in Alicante, Spain by @m2malletier. The factory was opened in 1981 by shoe designer Jaime Romero and his wife, together with 3 of his sons. Today, 25 artisans from the local town of Sax work in the factory, and have all been working there for at least 15 years. Everything is handcrafted using skills and traditions which have been passed from generation to generation.\n\nAll fashion info verified by @ecoage\n\nFor skin, the organic concealer/foundation 'Un' Cover-Up in colour 22 by @rmsbeauty was used with the @janeiredale Active Light Concealer under the eyes. Silicone-free Bronzer by @vitaliberata Trystal Self Tanning Bronzing Minerals.\n\nFor eyes, the Ecocert certified @antonymcosmetics Natural Eyeliner Pencil in Brown and Organic Nosiette Eyeshadow were used. For brows, Jane Iredale Pure Brow Gel was used and @herbivorebotanicals Coco Rose Tint in Coral, which is suitable for vegans, was used to tint the cheeks. Lips are lined with Jane Iredale Lip Pencil in Crimson before @iliabeauty Arabian Knights was added.",

The documentary also explores the friendships between Dr. Denis Mukwege (2016 Nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize), radical playwright and activist Eve Ensler (The Vagina Monolgoues) and human rights activist - and Director of the City of Joy - Christine Schuler-Deschryver, as they join forces to create this safe haven in the middle of violence-torn Eastern DRC. \nIt is a powerful and beautiful film about the power of the human spirit and I urge you to seek it out: http://drc.vday.org/about-city-of-joy",

        "I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the gender equality youth activists (Elizabeth, Mervis, Patricia and Tamara) I met with back in Lilongwe, Malawi. We discussed the issues girls face in Malawi and how organisations like @CAMFED, @UNWOMEN and the Malawi Girl Guides Association are helping them overcome these challenges. There is lots of work to be done, and more resources are desperately needed, but I‚Äôm hopeful for the future after seeing the enthusiasm these young women have for change. I know they will be holding President Mutharika to his commitment to end child marriage in Malawi within five years! #goal5\n\nMy jacket and trousers are from @edun. The sustainable organic cotton canvas material is sourced from a mill in South Africa. The material is untreated which avoids any harmful chemical treatments or finishing processes, which is much better for the environment.\n\nShoes were by @ancientgreeksandals. They are handmade locally by skilled craftsmen in Greece using traditional techniques that have existed for centuries. The chemical free, natural tan leather ages beautifully with time and wear. Perfect for #30wears!\n\nI‚Äôm rewearing recycled jewellery from @allbluesofficial #30wears\n\nPS. You may have noticed me talking about my clothes recently - I‚Äôm trying to be conscious about where my clothes come from and also about the people who make them. Just in case you wondering! (I‚Äôm not being paid by brands to do this btw!) All fashion info verified by @ecoage",

She's a yogi, feminist, artist, advocate, mother, warrior and all round gold hearted person. What a privilege it is to have met her. Welcome to Instagram Sophie! ‚ù§ Bonjour!

        "I had the most amazing day in Malawi today.\n\nThank you President Mutharika for being a #HeForShe Impact Champion and for making gender equality a priority in your Government! Thank you to all the traditional leaders who are implementing President Mutharika's policies - especially Chief Kachindamoto (she‚Äôs in the photo with me, she‚Äôs formidable and has been nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Terminator‚Äù!). She gave me such a warm welcome today. She has implemented the annulment of so many child marriages and restored the futures of these girls. With the help and collaboration of her local chiefs, mothers‚Äô groups and religious leaders she has managed to annul almost 1500 child marriages, sending the girls back to school. President Mutharika has committed to make child marriage a thing of the past in Malawi within the next five years. It was amazing to be on the ground with @UNWomen and Chief Kachindamoto to witness their work!\n\nMy @tomenyc white shirt is made from organic cotton and is part of their 'White Shirt Project‚Äô campaign. The project was conceived in 2014 to raise funds and awareness for the Freedom for All charity, which is fighting human trafficking and modern day slavery. \nThe silk skirt is by @zady. Zady partnered with @cocccon_prakesh, founded in 2012 by Chandra Prakash Jha, a fashion designer who wanted to help his community through fairer wages and a safer, more sustainable process. Instead of using toxic pesticides on the plants that the silkworm caterpillars eat, the farmers protect the trees by covering them with mosquito nets to protect the leaves from harmful birds and insects. Then the silk is brought to New York where expert sewers in New York‚Äôs famed Garment District create each piece. \nSandals by @nisoloshoes. The sandals were made by a team of expert shoemakers in Trujillo, Peru in a factory owned and operated by Nisolo that celebrates fair trade wages, safe working conditions, healthcare for all employees, and financial literacy & wellness training.\n\nAll fashion info verified by @ecoage",
